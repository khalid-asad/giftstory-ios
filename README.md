# Introduction
Ever wonder what the last gift you gave to someone dear to you was? 
Or if you had gotten them something similar before when deciding what to buy for their birthday?
Or maybe you just want to know the value of the last gift they gave you - if they gave you one.

Well Giftstory can help with that!
Giftstory stands for Gift-Story and is pronounced Gif-stuh-ree because it is quite literally a history of your gifts!

Currently, this SwiftUI and Combine application is hooked up to a backend Node.js server that i've made myself.

The following is currently supported:
- Sign in
- Registration
- Forgot Password
- Reset password

The following is planned to be added:
- Creating/Editing/Deleting friends
- Creating/Editing/Deleting Gifts given to and recieved for certain years
- Metrics on gifts and their histories
- Upcoming birthdays with a calendar and notifications
- Shopping suggestions based on your gift history for a certain friend
